# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a web-based visualizer for pathfinding algorithms, built using TypeScript and compiled with Vite. It allows users to visualize how different pathfinding algorithms navigate through a grid, providing a clear understanding of their workings.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using git and install the project dependencies to start the development server.
```
git clone https://github.com/rogelio-lopez/pathfinding-visualizer.git
```
```
cd pathfinding-visualizer
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```

## Usage
- Use the visualizer interface to set up your grid, choose an algorithm, and start the visualization.
- Observe how the algorithm navigates through the grid to find a path from a start point to an end point.
- Experiment with different algorithms and grid configurations to see how they perform.

## Future Enhancements
- Add weights so I can add more pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, A*).
- Add maze generation.
